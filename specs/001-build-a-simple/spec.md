# Feature Specification: Social Prediction Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple, social game where users can play during short breaks that tests their intuition, builds friendly competition, and gives them accomplishment through prediction accuracy and streak building. Users open the game and see 8-12 daily prediction questions with clear binary choices like "Will Bitcoin be above $100,000 at 6 PM?" They quickly make choices and bet virtual coins based on their confidence level. Users start each day with the same coin allocation, eliminating permanent bankruptcy fears while maintaining daily risk/reward excitement. Higher bets offer bigger multipliers but more risk. Users compete on daily leaderboards that reset each day and build prediction streaks for bonus multipliers. They share wins and achievements with friends, creating natural conversation and friendly rivalry. Users encounter varied categories - weather, crypto, sports, pop culture - with some resolving quickly for immediate gratification and others building anticipation for next-day results. Users participate meaningfully in 2-3 minute sessions, making this perfect for coffee breaks or commutes while building long-term progression through streaks and achievements."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: users, daily predictions, virtual coins, betting, leaderboards, streaks, achievements, social sharing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified: daily login ‚Üí view questions ‚Üí make predictions ‚Üí bet coins ‚Üí see results ‚Üí compete on leaderboards
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user opens the game during their coffee break and sees 8-12 daily prediction questions. They quickly scan through questions like "Will Bitcoin be above $100,000 at 6 PM?" and "Will it rain in New York today?" They make their predictions and decide how many virtual coins to bet based on their confidence. After submitting predictions, they check their position on the daily leaderboard and see their current prediction streak. When results come in, they earn coins for correct predictions with multipliers based on their bet amounts and streak bonuses. They share notable wins with friends and see social achievements that spark conversations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the game at the start of a new day, **When** they view the daily questions, **Then** they see 8-12 binary prediction questions from various categories with clear resolution times
2. **Given** a user wants to make a prediction, **When** they select their choice and bet amount, **Then** the system records their prediction and deducts the bet from their daily coin allocation
3. **Given** a user has made all their daily predictions, **When** results are determined, **Then** they receive coins for correct predictions with appropriate multipliers and streak bonuses
4. **Given** a user completes their daily session, **When** they check the leaderboard, **Then** they see their ranking among other players with scores resetting daily
5. **Given** a user achieves a notable result, **When** they choose to share, **Then** they can post their achievement to social platforms or share with friends

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user runs out of coins mid-session?
- How does the system handle tied leaderboard positions?
- What occurs if a prediction question becomes invalid or cancelled?
- How are users notified of results for delayed-resolution questions?
